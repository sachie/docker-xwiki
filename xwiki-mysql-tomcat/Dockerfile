# At this point the image is done and what remains below are the runtime configuration used by the user to configure
# the container that will be created out of the image. Namely the user can override some environment variables with
#   docker run -e "var1=val1" -e "var2=val2" ...
# The supported environment variables that can be overridden are:
# - MYSQL_USER: the name of the user configured for XWiki in the DB. Default is "xwiki". This is used to configure
#               xwiki's hibernate.cfg.xml file.
# - MYSQL_PASSWORD: the password for the user configured for XWiki in the DB. Default is "xwiki". This is used to
#                   configure xwiki's hibernate.cfg.xml file.
# Example:
#   docker run -it -e "MYSQL_USER=xwiki" -e "MYSQL_PASSWORD=xwiki" <imagename>

# Starts XWiki by starting Tomcat. All options passed to "docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]"
# are also passed to start_xwiki.sh. However at the moment start_xwiki.sh doesn't support any parameters and all
# configurations are done through environment variable overrides (see above).
ENTRYPOINT ["start_xwiki.sh"]

# When no options are passed on the "docker run" command line we display a message explaining what environment
# variables can be overridden.
# Note: This is not implemented yet and FTM --info does nothing.
